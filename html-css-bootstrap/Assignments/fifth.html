   <h1>My Favourite Hobby:Drawing</h1> 
   <h4>Why I like it</h4>
   <p>Drawing is my favourite hobby because it allows me to express my thoughts and emotions
   freely through art. I enjoy drawing because it gives me a sense of peace and relaxation, 
   especially when I am stressed or tired. When I draw, I can imagine new ideas and bring them 
   to life on paper using colors, shapes, and lines. It also helps improve my creativity and concentration.
   Drawing makes me feel happy and confident, as each completed artwork gives me satisfaction and motivates me to learn and create more.</p>
   <h4>How I spend time doing it</h4>
   <p>I spend my time drawing by sitting in a quiet place with my sketchbook and pencils. 
   I usually start by thinking of an idea or looking at nature, pictures, or objects around me for inspiration.
   Sometimes I draw simple sketches, and other times I add colors to make my drawings more attractive. 
   I enjoy experimenting with different styles and shading techniques. Drawing in my free time helps me relax, 
   stay creative, and use my time in a meaningful way.</p>
   <h4>Daily Routine</h4>
   <p>My daily routine starts early in the morning when I wake up and get ready for the day.
   I complete my basic activities and have breakfast before leaving for my work or studies. 
   I try to manage my time properly by focusing on my tasks and responsibilities throughout the day. 
   In the evening, I spend some time relaxing, practicing my hobbies, or revising what I learned. 
   At night, I have dinner with my family and prepare for the next day before going to bed. 
   This routine helps me stay organized, disciplined, and active every day.</p>
