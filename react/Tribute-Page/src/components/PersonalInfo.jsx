     Singer out of 18 nominations. She won her first two awards in 1967
     and 1968, when her elder sister Lata Mangeshkar still used to accept
     the award (Lata Mangeshkar asked not to be considered for the award 
     nominations after 1969 to promote new talent.) After receiving the award 
     in 1979, Asha Bhosle emulated her sister and requested that her name not 
     be considered for the nominations hereafter. Despite this, she is the most
    frequent winner of this award to date, tying with Alka Yagnik. She was later 
    given a Special Award for Rangeela Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001`
